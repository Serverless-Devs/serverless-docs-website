> * It should be noted that this tool only supports publishing packages to the default registry (registry.devsapp.cn/simple). If you want to publish to other registries, you can refer to:
> - If it is a Github or Gitee source, you only need to create a repository and release a version. For example, a demo repository is created under the devsapp organization of Github, and a Release is released. At this time, you can directly [switch the source to Github source](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/blob/master/docs/en/command/set.md#set-registry-command) , and write the component as `organization name/repository name`, such as `devsapp/demo`, the system can automatically detect and load related components;
> - If it is another Registry that complies with the [SRM specification](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/tree/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_registry_model), you can provide the Registry according to the The platform determines the relevant tools;


## Login function: login

Before operating the Registry, there needs to be an identity verification logic (for example, you can only update packages belonging to you, etc.), so before using the Registry function, you need to perform login-related operations.

There are two modes of login:

- Mode 1: You already have the `token` information after login, you can use `s cli registry login --token <token>` to directly configure the `token`;
- Mode 2: There is no `token` information after login, or the Serverless Registry has not been registered. At this time, you can directly open the browser through `s cli registry login`, and log in and authorize according to the operation prompts. When the page is displayed as follows, it means that Successful landing:

    At this point, you can also see a successful reminder on the client side:

> * It should be noted that Serverless Registry does not provide additional registration functions, and only relies on Github authorization operations for user identity identification. If you have any questions in the later use process, please send an email to service@52exe.cn for communication communicate with.


> todo: Since China opens Github, it will be tested by the network, so there is room for optimization in the login link


## Publish Package: publish

> This operation needs to be done after completing the [login link](#Login-function-login).

Under the project that conforms to the specification of [Serverless Package](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/tree/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_package_model), you can pass the `publish` command, Publish the component.

For example, you can directly execute: `s cli registry publish`

> For the directory structure of Package and related values ​​and specifications, please refer to [Package Model](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/blob/master/spec/en/0.0.2/serverless_package_model/3.package_model.md);

## View the list of Package: list

> This operation needs to be done after completing the [login link](#Login-function-login).

Use the `list` command to view the components published by the currently logged in Serverless Registry account, for example: `s cli registry list`:

````
$ s cli registry list
- package: ros-test
  description: Deploy the project through Alibaba Cloud ROS
  version: 0.0.10
  zipball_url: https://registry.devsapp.cn/simple/ros-test/zipball/0.0.10
- package: fc-core

  description: Alibaba Cloud Function Computing Basic Components
  version: 0.1.38
  zipball_url: https://registry.devsapp.cn/simple/devsapp/fc/zipball/0.1.38
````

## View the version information of a package: versions

Use the `versions` command to view the valid version information of the specified package.

The command has one parameter:

- `name`: Indicates the Package name

$ s cli registry retoken
Serverless Registry login token reset succeeded.
End of method: retoken

```

Scenarios of using `token` independently: you need to publish some packages in the pipeline, you can get the `token`, and configure the `token` through `s cli registry login --token xxxxx` in the pipeline.

## Search for the specified Package: search

Use the `search` command to search for related package information.

The command has two parameters:

- `keyword`: search keyword
- `type`: Package type, the value is `Component` or `Application`, `Plugin`
