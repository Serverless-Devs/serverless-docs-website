### Package and Package Model

Package consists of standard code that can implement a feature or represent a component or an application. Package Model represents a specification and a group of rules. 

- Package consist of the code that conforms to the SPM specification, which is used to implement model features, including but not limited to deploying business logics to the Serverless platform and debugging the Serverless application code.
- Package Model is the Package development specification of Serverless Devs. Only Serverless Package that conforms to the specification can be recognized by Serverless Devs developer tools and can be published to Serverless Registry platforms that follow the Serverless Registry Model specification.
