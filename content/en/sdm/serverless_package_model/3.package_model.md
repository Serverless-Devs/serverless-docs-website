## Model structure

- Component model: A component model can be referenced in applications and execute expected features based on user input instructions on Serverless Devs. For example, if the FC component is referenced in an application, users can deploy a function by passing in the Deploy command. The FC component is developed based on the component model to conform to the component development specification.
- Application model: An application model is an application that can be initialized on Serverless Devs. Generally, an application has a YAML file in which one or more components used to handle specified tasks are included. Applications are developed based on the application model to conform to the application development specification.

## Model specification

### Component model specification

Component models are standardized and defined based on specified files. We recommend that the directory of a component model is in the following structure：

```
|- src # You can change the directory name
|   └── Code directory    
|- package.json: You need to define the main field
|- publish.yaml: The description of the project resources  
|- readme.md: The introduction to the project
|- version.md: The updates of the version
```

The following table describes parameters in the structure：

| Directory    | Required          | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| src          | Yes (Recommended) | The directory that contains all the  required files to build the project in a unified manner. You can change the  name of the directory, and have the directory tiled under the project. We  recommend that you use src as the directory for unified file management. |
| package.json | Yes               | The package.json file of Node.js, in which  the handler of the component is recorded. |
| publish.yaml | Yes               | The Serverless Devs Package development  documentation.      |
| readme.md    | Yes               | The description or the help documentation  of the component. |
| version.md   | Yes (Recommended) | The version description, such as the  updates of the current version. |


#### Component model metadata

The component model metadata is described in the `publish.yaml` file, and the metadata is identified and referenced in Serverless Registry and Serverless Devs developer tools. 

The `publish.yaml` file must conform to the following basic syntax:


```yaml

                    examples:
                      - true
```

#### Component model code specification

In the component model, the code composition specification has two parts:
- The address of the entry file needs to be clearly described in `package.json`; for example `{"main": "./dist/index.js"}`;
- Implement the corresponding user method in the code. For example, Package developers hope that users can deploy the project through the deploy command, then they can implement a deploy method and implement the corresponding deployment capabilities in the method;

For the code specification part, you can refer to the following cases:

```typescript
import logger from './common/logger';
import { InputProps } from './common/entity';

export default class ComponentDemo {
  /**
   * demo 实例
   * @param inputs
   * @returns
   */
  public async test(inputs: InputProps) {
    logger.debug(`input: ${JSON.stringify(inputs.props)}`);
    logger.info('command test');
    return { hello: 'world' };
  }
}
```

The structure of the input parameter `inputs` is:

```json
{
    "command": "", 
    "project": {
        "projectName": "", 
        "component": "",
        "provider": "",
        "access": ""
    },
    "credentials": {},
    "prop": {},
    "args": "",
    "argsObj": []
}
```

| Directory   | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| command     | The command that is used by the user.                        |
| project     | The basic information about the project of  the user.        |
| credentials | The information about the key.                               |
| prop        | The properties or parameters that the user  configures.      |
| args        | The parameter that is passed by the user.  The passed parameter is a string. |
| argsObj     | The parameter that is passed by the user.  The parameter is parsed and is passed as an array. |


In the preceding sample code, a test method is contained. You can use the test method to implement the testing feature. This way, when the user runs the test command, the system calls the method by using the related parameters. Example:

In this example, a component named hexo is used. The core code of the hexo component contains a test method and is displayed in the preceding sample code. The YAML file on the user side includes the following information:

```yaml
edition: 1.0.0        #  The version of the YAML specification. The version conforms to the semantic versioning specification.
name: FullStack       #  The name of the project.
access: xxx-account1  #  The alias of the key.

services:
  HexoComponent:
    component: hexo
    props:
      region: 'cn-hangzhou'
      codeUri: './src'
```

When the user runs the` s test mytest -a -b abc` command, the following `inputs` are returned in your `test` method:

```json
{
    "command": "test", 
    "project": {
        "projectName": "HexoComponent", 
        "component": "hexo",
        "provider": "alibaba",
        "access": "release"
    },
    "credentials": {
        "AccountID": "********",
        "AccessKeyID": "********",
        "AccessKeySecret": "********"
    },
    "prop": {
        "Region": "cn-hangzhou",
        "CodeUri": "./src"
    },
    "args": "mytest -a -b abc",
    "argsObj": [
      "mytest", "-a", "-b", "abc"
    ]
}
```

In this case, the test method prints the logs and returns the following output in Command Prompt: `{ "hello": "world" }`.

### Application model specification

Application models are standardized and defined based on specified files. We recommend that the directory of an application model is in the following structure:

```
|- src # You can remain the directory name unchanged.
|   └── Application directory
|   └── s.yml: The description file of the application.
|- publish.yaml: The resource description of the project.   
|- readme.md: The brief introduction to the project.  
|- version.md: The updates of the version.
```

The following table describes the parameters in the structure:

| Directory    | Required          | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| src          | Yes               | The directory in which the application is  stored.           |
| s.yml        | Yes               | The YAML file that describes resources of  the application, which must conform to the publish.yaml specification. |
| publish.yaml | Yes               | The Serverless Devs Package development  documentation.      |
| readme.md    | Yes               | The description or the help documentation  of the application. |
| version.md   | Yes (Recommended) | The description of the version, such as the  updates of the current version. |

#### Application model metadata

The component model metadata is described in the `publish.yaml` file, and the metadata is identified and initialized in Serverless Registry and Serverless Devs developer tools. 

The `publish.yaml` file must conform to the following basic syntax:

```yaml
Edition: 0.0.2
Type: Application
Name:The name of the application.
Provider:
  - The name of the cloud vendor. 
Version: The version of the application. Example:0.0.1.
Description: The brief description or introduction to the application.
HomePage: The homepage of the project.
Tags: #The details of tags.

      - 创建函数 # 所需要的权限
```

    
###### Parameters

In the application model, although there is already a complete `s.yaml` to describe the application information, there are actually situations such as the following:
- Some parameters in `s.yaml` need to be filled in by the user. For example, some applications need to connect to the database. In this case, the user needs to fill in the parameters when initializing the application;
- Although some parameters in `s.yaml` have default values, they still require user attention, or users need to customize in some cases;
Therefore, the Serverless Package model provides the `Parameters` parameter for the Application type. Through this parameter, you can describe the relevant parameters in `s.yaml`, for example:
    
```yaml
Parameters: # Standard JSON scheme
  type: object
  additionalProperties: false # Adding other attributes is not allowed
  required: 
    - mysqlName
    - regionName
  properties:
    mysqlName: # Regular check
      type: string, 
      description: Mysql连接串
      title: Mysql连接串
      pattern: '^mysql:.*$'
    regionName: # 枚举类型
      type: string,
      description: 地域Region
      default: cn-hangzhou 
      title: 地域
      enum:
        - cn-beijing
        - cn-hangzhou
        - cn-shanghai
```

At this point, the field can be referenced in `s.yaml`, for example:
    
```yaml
edition: 1.0.0 # Command-line YAML specification version, following the Semantic Versioning specification
name: component-test # project name
vars: # [Global variables, available to each service]
  domain: xxxx.yyy.com

services:
  component-test:
    component: demo
    props:
      name: {{ inputsrgs }}
```
    
For compatibility with [spec 0.0.1](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/blob/master/spec/en/0.0.1/serverless_package_model/3.package_model.md#%E5%BA% 94%E7%94%A8%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E8%A7%84%E8%8C%83), about the special format definition of `s.yaml`, in the current version:
1. If there is content similar to `'{{ bucket | alibaba oss bucket }}'` in `s.yaml`, the user is directly reminded to enter a parameter such as bucket as a required parameter in Yaml, and the ` The content "alibaba oss bucket" after |` is used to explain the meaning of this parameter;
2. If content similar to `"{{ access }}"` exists in `s.yaml`, then judge whether the `Parameters` parameter and related Key exist in `publish.yaml`:
    - If it exists, it will be corresponding by default;
    - If it does not exist, directly remind the user that a parameter such as access needs to be input as a necessary parameter in Yaml;

> Regarding the format of the Parameters parameter, it strictly follows the specification standard of JSON Scheme. For the specific format.
